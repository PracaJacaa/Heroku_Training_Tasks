# Heroku_Training_Tasks
This is my journey with automation in Selenium on https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

# HerokuABTest.py
I've decided that the test's exit condition will be the address of the new page. It would be a good idea to add:
if page_address == exit_condition ---> print("Pass")
To avoid printing the results manually

# Heroku_AddRemove_Elements.py
I had a lot of fun with this, it reminded me of function calls, conditional statements, a little stress test in the form of printing 100 elements and their removal, and executing a JavaScript script.

# HerokuDragAndDrop.py
First, I brought in and made use of different classes like 'webdriver,' 'By,' 'ActionChains,' 'NoSuchElementException,' and
'time.' Then, I added error handling to deal with situations where we can't find 'column A' or 'column B.' I also learned how
to perform drag-and-drop actions using ActionChains. To make the code more understandable, I included comments that explain
what's happening at each step. These comments should help others follow the logic behind my actions.
